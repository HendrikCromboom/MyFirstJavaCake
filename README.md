# MyFirstJavaCake

The purpose of this project is to learn java on my previous experience as a c# developer.

The goal is to create a cmd text based card battle game.

The tasks/requirements will be as follows:

-A game flow to start a game

-A random card generator

-A functional turn based flow with user interaction

-A very basic AI to battle against
