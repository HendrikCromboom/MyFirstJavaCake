# MyFirstJavaCake
-----------------

## Purpose
-----------------

The purpose of this project is to learn java on my previous experience as a c# developer.

The goal is to create a cmd text based card battle game.

The tasks will be as follows:

-A game flow to start a game

-A random card generator

-A functional turn based flow with user interaction

-A very basic AI to battle against

The requirements will be as follows:

-To apply OOP/SOLID

-To explore the semantic differences between java and c#

-To mess around as much as I possibly can(this will include me typing out useless code just for the sake of refactoring it with a design pattern) in order to get a more intuitive feel of the syntax and semantics
